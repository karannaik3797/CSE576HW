But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . __eou__ So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? __eou__ It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper .

He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . __eou__ Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . __eou__ It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . __eou__ I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . __eou__ All right .

It should be enough for any student needs you might have . What department are you in ? __eou__ History . __eou__ Well , so you will mostly be using word processing , for writing papers .

It's reasonable to ask your friends . But believe me , most of the students here in the university-Asian students included-most of them use Apple . __eou__ Well , thanks for your advice .

When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or eight seconds .

To some extent your idea holds water . Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense , but with time it became something more than defense skills . Now we are apt to treat it as an art . __eou__ An art ! You have a good point there . So it is called martial arts in English . The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely . They even made fighting a great enjoyment , so marvelous and fascinating . __eou__ Thanks for your compliment ! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics . Do you know Jin Yong ? __eou__ I know he is a martial arts fiction writer . But I've read none of his novels . __eou__ All of his works have been translated into English . I recommend you to read one or two works of his . You'll get a general glimpse into Chinese kung fu culture . When you go through the pages , you are likely to feel they are not about kung fu alone , but cover all walks of life . __eou__ I see . They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements . __eou__ Yes , take philosophy , for instance . What makes a true , respectable da via , or a warrior hero ? It's not enough only to be formidable . It also involves a man's character , sense of justice , and values of life . __eou__ So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation , isn't it ? __eou__ Indeed , you're exactly right ! __eou__\n",

And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance . __eou__ Correct ! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable . __eou__ Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China . __eou__ There's another distinctive contrast . Both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess . __eou__ You mean , xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around ? __eou__ Sure .

Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends ' homes , their parents would offer me a cup of hot , strong tea , though they never inquired of me about whether I want it . __eou__ You've got a point there . It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit . There is no need to ask if he needs it or not , or if he wants something else . It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea . __eou__ So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip . In that case , I guess , in return , the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it . __eou__ It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop . But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face . When the host pours hot water into his cup , he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table , meaning \" Thanks \" . No matter if he likes it or not , it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup . __eou__ So next time , I'd better take a few sips , to ' save face ' at least , right ? __eou__ Sure . The guest is welcomed by being served tea . But if after chatting for a while , the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea , or add some hot water , he is giving another signal . __eou__ What does that imply , then ? __eou__ More often than not , the understatement is ' I'm afraid it's time you leave ' . __eou__\n",

Nowadays , living in the same city as one's relatives is becoming rare . __eou__ That's true . You know , some husbands and wives don't even live in the same city any more . __eou__ Would you consider having your parents live with you when they get older ? __eou__ I guess I'm a bit old-fashioned . I'd rather have my parents live with me than live in a retirement room . __eou__ That's very respectable , but I could never live with my parents . I usually only see them at our christmas celebration — and that's enough ! __eou__ How about your other siblings ?

They enjoy spending their free time with my parents . I guess in that respect , I'm the black sheep of the family . __eou__ I see . Do your parents ever ask you to come home to visit them more often ? __eou__ They're always asking me to come home , but I think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other . Whenever we see each other , all we do is fight . __eou__\n",

It ’ s disgusting . ” The Chinese friend replied , “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating . It ’ s even worse . ” __eou__ Everyone has his own habits , but these habits are not very good . The noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite . __eou__ I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States . Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread . Before each course , the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way . We always said “ American way . ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners . What is the Chinese way ? __eou__ The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated . The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate . I assume it is less complicated , right ? __eou__ Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits . __eou__ It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background . Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles . We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.Westerners like to say , “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners . ” Is there such an expression in Chinese ? __eou__ Yes . We say “ eat well and drink well . ” __eou__\n",

But people's consuming attitudes are changing quickly . __eou__ That's true . Well , it's obvious that fashion is not a cheap thing . So , do you spend all your money on it ? __eou__ No . Fashion is just part of my life , which improves its quality . But also , I'm good at financing . I have a credit card , but I never overdraft . __eou__ How is it that you are my mom's sis ? You two are so different . She always picks up bargains and spends more than she earns . You do so much better than her . __eou__ I have to say that's just the result of difference of our consumptive habits . __eou__\n",

Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise . __eou__ What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ? __eou__ One that I recommend is that you lie on your back .

First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ? __eou__ OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay . __eou__ Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work . __eou__ All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now . __eou__ That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take . __eou__ Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ? __eou__ That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead . __eou__ I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan . __eou__ No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like .

He said she makes really good sushi . __eou__ Hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . Well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course . __eou__ Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish . __eou__ I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ? __eou__ Yes , Chardonnay is a white wine , but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet . Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . I'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand . __eou__ Sauvignon Blanc ? What's that ? __eou__ That's another varietal , or type of grape , just like Chardonnay . __eou__ Let's see . The label says it's got \" attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp , mineral flavors and a bonedry finish . Serve chilled . \" Oh , no , how long will it take to chill the wine ? I'm on my way to the dinner now . __eou__ It's OK , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely . __eou__ All right . What varietal is that ? __eou__ Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly Viognier , I'd guess . __eou__ And you think this is a good wine ? __eou__ Yes , this is one of our best-sellers . It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . It's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma . __eou__ Perfect !

Let ’ s get started ! __eou__ Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . __eou__ Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . __eou__ Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . __eou__ Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! __eou__ That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna !

Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing , the animation was very well done , and the story was simply enchanting . __eou__ I think otherwise . Even though the animation was technically strong , and as you say , the score and songs performed by Elton John were great , the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart . And I would dare to say , it was too predictable . __eou__ Predictable ! How ! Come on Dick , It ’ s a G-rated movie ! It ’ s for the kids ! It ’ s not a thriller ! __eou__ Well , that ’ s just it . It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies , or the dark , grim portrayal of Scar . Even so , the film is linear . Mufasal dies , Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault . Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his . It ’ s just too cliche . __eou__ How can it be cliche ? It ’ s a fable ! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story !

For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . What ’ s more , try to avoid a too causal style . __eou__ Can I wear T-shirt and jeans for the job interview ? __eou__ You ’ d better not . Informal clothes like sports shirts , tom jeans or dirty sneakers convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . __eou__ I've got it .

Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . __eou__ Yeah , that's very important . __eou__ So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . __eou__ I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . __eou__ That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . __eou__ It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . __eou__ It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . __eou__ But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . __eou__ I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . __eou__ It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . __eou__ You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . __eou__ I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . __eou__ You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . __eou__ It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . __eou__ It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . __eou__\n",

If you can manage to boost it a bit , we ’ ll consider giving you a better discount . __eou__ As far as a trial order is concerned , the quantity is by no means small . And generally speaking , we like to profit from a trial order . I hope you ’ ll be able to meet our requirements . __eou__ Well , as this is the first deal between us , we agree to give you an one-percent discount as a special encouragement . __eou__ 1 % ? That ’ s too low a rate . Could you see your way to increase it to 2 % ? . __eou__ I ’ m afraid we have really made a great concession , and could not go any further . __eou__ It seems this is the only proposal for me to accept . I ’ ll come again tomorrow to discuss it in detail . __eou__ All right . See you tomorrow . __eou__\n",

The offer is valid for five days . __eou__ Why , your price has soared . It ’ s almost 25 % higher than last year ’ s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price . __eou__ I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere . __eou__ I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources . __eou__ But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries . __eou__ I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years . __eou__ There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price . __eou__ Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price .
