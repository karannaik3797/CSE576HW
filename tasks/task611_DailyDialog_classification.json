But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . __eou__ So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? __eou__ It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . __eou__ And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? __eou__ Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . __eou__ Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . __eou__ It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . __eou__ I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . __eou__ All right .

But if you just ride comfortably along the city lanes , you might choose a road bike . __eou__ Are they designed differently ? __eou__ A road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame . Its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars . It's not particularly beefy in construction , and generally , it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces . In contrast , mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame . You sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over . __eou__\n",

Every intellectual wishing to gain any insight into Chinese culture should learn to play Go . __eou__ I heard it is included in the four major arts of China , is it ? __eou__ Sure . It was considered desirable that a well-educated ancient Chinese scholar could be well versed in zither , weigh , calligraphy and painting . I think weigh is the most fantastic of them . It embodies ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural profoundness . __eou__ I know it is quite different from Western chess . __eou__ Yes . Playing chess is a very aggressive experience . All the pieces are supposed to capture their opponents . Whenever I start a chess game , I can't help but imagine a concrete battle in which all fighters stand ready to kill . __eou__ But isn't it the same with wiki ? __eou__ Certainly not . The object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent . In other words , each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board . Hence , chess aims to kill , while weigh is most concerned with howso survive . __eou__\n",

Wow , that's exciting ! __eou__ Yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility . __eou__ Yeah . I still remember my first car . It was an old clunker that my dad gave me when I turned 17 . I drove it around for a couple of years until I scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car . __eou__ I'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us . __eou__ Yeah , it is a tough call .

Chicken ? __eou__ There are many amazing dishes to choose from . We can have some chicken tikka masala which is an amazing curry .

Since you don ' t use any utensils to eat , you can use this bread to scoop up the curry or rice . __eou__ What about veggies ? __eou__ They have a good variety of vegetable-based dishes like talak panter , vegetable samosas or daal . __eou__ It all sounds exquisite !

Pull up a chair . __eou__ Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ? __eou__ OK , let's start from the top of your pay stub . This number here represents your gross pay . __eou__ Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work . __eou__ All right , I see . So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now . __eou__ That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take . __eou__ Yeah , I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that . So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level ? __eou__ That's right . Not all states have an income tax . Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead . __eou__ I see . All right , well I think everything else I can figure out on my own . The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory . Thanks for your help , Susan . __eou__ No problem ! All those deductions do add up , and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like . I can understand why you'd want some explanation . __eou__ Yeah , I guess it's the same in the UK , I just never paid much attention . See you later ! __eou__\n",

I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring . __eou__ OK , do you know what kind of food will be served ? __eou__ Well , his wife is Japanese . He said she makes really good sushi . __eou__ Hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . Well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course . __eou__ Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ? __eou__ No , I don't think so . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish . __eou__ I see . So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay ? That's a white wine , right ? __eou__ Yes , Chardonnay is a white wine , but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet . Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . I'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand . __eou__ Sauvignon Blanc ? What's that ? __eou__ That's another varietal , or type of grape , just like Chardonnay . __eou__ Let's see . The label says it's got \" attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp , mineral flavors and a bonedry finish . Serve chilled . \" Oh , no , how long will it take to chill the wine ? I'm on my way to the dinner now . __eou__ It's OK , don't worry , we'll just choose a wine from the cooler . We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here , but ... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely . __eou__ All right . What varietal is that ? __eou__ Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label . The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine . This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes , mostly Viognier , I'd guess . __eou__ And you think this is a good wine ? __eou__ Yes , this is one of our best-sellers . It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier , which means it's more approachable . It's light and crisp , with a bit of a vanilla aroma . __eou__ Perfect !

Let ’ s get started ! __eou__ Let ’ s start with the basics , bread . Bread is an important ingredient here . You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria , freshness , crumb and color . If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven , or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color . __eou__ Now that our bread is ready , let ’ s talk about the ingredients ! Of course , each person ’ s palate is different , but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich . I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich . __eou__ Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light . The best choices here are evident — cucumbers , tomatoes , onions , sweet pepper or chilli , lettuce and , of course , herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them . As for aubergines , mushrooms and asparagus , I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil . __eou__ Last but not least , we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich . We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper , or we can combine mustard sauce , mayonnaise , ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor ! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt ! __eou__ That ’ s all the time we have for today , but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna !

I just want to be able to get online , play games and chat with my friends . Oh , and watch movies online as well . __eou__ Well , this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs . I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes . That way you can play games online without any lag . This package also includes a wireless router and a personal firewall absolutely free ! __eou__ Do I have to pay an installation fee ? __eou__ Lucky for you , this month we aren ’ t charging our normal installation fee . You are saving yourself 100 bucks right there ! And we ’ ll throw in this pen drive ! __eou__ Awesome ! __eou__\n",

How did you cut this so bad ? __eou__ I ran it against that fence pole as I crashed . What do you think ? Damn , it hurts ! __eou__ We'll have to get you to a hospital .

I slid out . __eou__ Yes , I almost slid too.Alright . This tourniquet is tight . How does it feel ? __eou__ Make it tighter . I want the blood stopped.Then wrap some bandages around the cut . Then we can go . Ouch ! I hope I can walk . __eou__ Alright , I'm twisting it around . You tell me when to stop . __eou__ There . Stop ! __eou__\n",

That's more fashionable now . __eou__ Alright . You are the expert . I'm happy to have your recommendation . __eou__ So I will cut the sides just above the ear .

And I see some split ends . __eou__ Yes , I know my hair is quite thin.It runs in my family . Everybody has very thin hair . __eou__ The problem is the split ends . They make your hair look even more frizzy . __eou__ I don't know what to do about it . __eou__ Well , there are two things you can do.First , don't blow-dry your hair for so long after you shower . Let it dry naturally.That is easier on the hair , so you won't get split ends.Second , buy a g __eou__ Do you sell conditioner here ? __eou__ Of course . I have one I can suggest . __eou__ Great . I would be happy to try it . I know my hair doesn't look good now . It's too weak . __eou__ The problem is the split ends . __eou__\n",

To tell you the truth , I plan to apply for Harvard after graduation from high school . It ’ s better to get to know it . What about you ? __eou__ I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays . __eou__ Oh , my God ! John , I didn ’ t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . __eou__ Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion . __eou__ But I ’ m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ? __eou__ Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U . S . is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world . __eou__ I've heard about it a little bit before , but I don ’ t understand . How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? __eou__ That ’ s a little complicated . You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on . Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life . Guess what ? Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion . __eou__ Really ? __eou__ Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . __eou__ Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? __eou__ Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . __eou__ How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ? __eou__ That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries . __eou__ So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? __eou__ Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . __eou__ Why did they want to found a college ? __eou__ Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . __eou__ Oh , I see . __eou__ Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . __eou__ When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? __eou__ In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman . __eou__ It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion . __eou__ Therefore , it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard . __eou__ Wow , I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history . __eou__ Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U . S . __eou__ I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard . __eou__ Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States . So you have to know the U . S . history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard . The two are closely related . __eou__ That ’ s right . I have a lot to learn from you . __eou__ You can ask me any question at any time . __eou__\n",
