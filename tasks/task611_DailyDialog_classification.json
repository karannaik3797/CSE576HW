I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . __eou__ We need to find a good realtor . __eou__ Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive . __eou__ What do you mean ? __eou__ Realtors always get a commission . If the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him . __eou__ But doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles . __eou__ Yes , that's often true . But you have to pay them . __eou__ I still think we should have a realtor . We're new in this country . We don't know all the laws of buying a house . And also , the realtor will inspect the house . He can tell us if the house has any problems . __eou__ Of course we need a house inspector . But we can hire an inspector on our own . As for the legal problems , I have friends . They can help us . __eou__ So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ? __eou__ It takes a little more time . We have to check the ads in the paper . Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads . Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them . __eou__ And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? __eou__ Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . __eou__ Why ? __eou__ That is because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . __eou__ Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . __eou__ It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That's why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . __eou__ I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . __eou__ All right .
