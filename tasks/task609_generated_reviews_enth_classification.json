    "Definition": "In this task, we are given a Dataset having english language product reviews generated from CTRL and then those reviews are given value from 1 to 5 based on the reviews of the product. Now, here we are going to classify task based on the review_rating for generated reviews. So here we have 5 classes with values ranging from 1 to 5 and we will consider a value to be good review if its review rating value is greater than 3 else bad review",
